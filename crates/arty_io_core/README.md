Stable contracts for integrating I/O drivers into thread-aware runtimes.

Drivers provide I/O; runtimes provide scheduling. This crate defines
the interfaces between them, but provides neither a runtime nor an I/O implementation.

## How drivers work

Applications access a driver’s I/O operations through an [`IoContext`][__link0]. It creates a
worker-local [`Driver`][__link1] for each runtime worker. The driver processes submissions and
completions in bounded calls to [`Driver::execute_cycle`][__link2].

### Primary and secondary drivers

A worker has at most one [`Primary`][__link3] driver. [`DriverOptions`][__link4] lists the
roles available during creation, and [`DriverInstance`][__link5] returns the selected role. A primary
may wait on the worker for up to [`Cycle::max_wait`][__link6]; a zero wait bound means no waiting.

[`Secondary`][__link7] drivers must not block the worker. They may schedule
background waits on independent execution capacity.

## Runtime responsibilities

The runtime clones and relocates contexts to its workers, assigns driver roles, and
supplies [`DriverOptions`][__link8]. It completes a non-blocking, zero-wait initialization cycle
before publishing a context.
It also supplies an owner waker for requesting another cycle and a [`SystemTaskSpawner`][__link9] for
blocking system work. Each driver supplies a waker that interrupts its pending completion wait.

Each logical cycle uses a shared time snapshot and wait bound. The runtime invokes
secondaries before the primary. If there is no primary, the runtime retains responsibility
for parking the worker.

## Shutdown

The runtime stops normal cycles and calls [`Driver::shutdown`][__link10] for every driver, continuing
after a [`ShutdownError`][__link11]. Each driver closes admission and drains its resources within a
bounded wait, independently of other drivers on the same worker. Contexts remain valid as
closed handles.

## Example and reference

The [single-thread runtime example][__link12] demonstrates registration and driver roles. Its sample
drivers perform no I/O and use a no-op tracker; a runtime serving native I/O must implement
the coordination described above.
